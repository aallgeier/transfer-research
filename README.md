## Code from transfer learning research
Author: Allegra Allgeier

## Acknowledgements
My code is largely based on the PyTorch tutorials below:<br>
https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/transfer_learning_tutorial.html<br>
https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/data_tutorial.html<br>
It is a combination of lines directly from the above tutorials (or slightly modified) and my own. Also inspired by the fine_tune() method from fast.ai
