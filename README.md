## Project Name 
ResNet Does Not Perform Intelligent Understanding of Picture in Image Recognition

## Summary
Found through experiments and theoretical considerations that ResNet recognizes local patterns, instead of global object shapes, and exploits spurious correlations.<br>

## Acknowledgements
My code is largely based on the PyTorch tutorials below:<br>
https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/transfer_learning_tutorial.html<br>
https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/data_tutorial.html<br>
It is a combination of lines directly from the above tutorials (or slightly modified) and my own. Also inspired by the fine_tune() method from fast.ai
